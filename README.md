## Design principles

### Colors

Use sepia toning/filter (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_print_toning#Sepia_toning) for background images for now. Later on the colors should be more saturated, dark and represent the general theme.

Text color sould be either black (#000) or white (#FFF), with a black or dark red (#190000) dropshadow.

### Fonts

Primarily the font Norefund should be used in promotional material (Found here at Norefund.tff/.woff) and Titillium Web otherwise (again, TitilliumWeb-Regular.ttf). Norefund can be found at https://www.dafont.com/no-refunds.font and TitilliumWeb at https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Titillium+Web.
